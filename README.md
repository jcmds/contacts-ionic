# Overview
Ionic Framework focuses on the frontend UX and UI interaction of an app — UI controls, interactions, gestures, animations. 
It's easy to learn, and integrates with other libraries or frameworks, such as Angular, React, or Vue. Alternatively, 
it can be used standalone without any frontend framework using a simple script include. 
If you’d like to learn more about Ionic Framework before diving in, we created a video to walk you through the basics.

## One codebase, running everywhere

Ionic is the only mobile app stack that enables web developers to build apps for all major app stores and the mobile web from a single codebase. 
And with Adaptive Styling, Ionic apps look and feel at home on every device.

### A focus on performance

Ionic is built to perform and behave great on the latest mobile devices with best practices like efficient hardware accelerated transitions, and touch-optimized gestures.

### Clean, simple, and functional design

Ionic is designed to work and display beautifully on all current mobile devices and platforms. 
With ready-made components, typography, and a gorgeous (yet extensible) base theme that adapts to each platform, you'll be building in style.

### Native and Web optimized

Ionic emulates native app UI guidelines and uses native SDKs, bringing the UI standards and device features of native apps together with the full power and flexibility of the open web. 
Ionic uses Capacitor (or Cordova) to deploy natively, or runs in the browser as a Progressive Web App.
